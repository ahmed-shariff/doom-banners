+ that if these images are not made by you then you need to add the name of the
  artist and the licence that it is using for distribution. it preferably needs
  to be a [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/][Creative Commons]]  but as long as its permissive it should be fine
+ That these images are a cetain size around the size of =350x300= pixels. Larger
