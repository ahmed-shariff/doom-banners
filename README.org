#+TITLE: All the splash images

This is a selection of images and banners that are used as splash images in the
emacs and doom community this is a place to aggregate and share them

* Using the Icons
you can set the icons by adding this line to your ~config.el~ in [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom emacs]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq fancy-splash-image "/path/to/image")
#+end_src

* Contributing
Feel free to make pull requests to add your splashes! just keep in mind..

+ that if these images are not made by you then you need to add the name of the
  artist and the licence that it is using for distribution. it preferably needs
  to be a [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/][Creative Commons]]  but as long as its permissive it should be fine.
  *If it does not meet this step I can't merge it*

+ Large images can dominate and hurt the usability of the dashboard. I recommend
  =400x400= for 1080p screens but I am a sample size of one. It maybe beneficial
  to you to resize the image to a different size
  if you have image magic installed this command will resize the image to 400x400
 #+begin_src shell
 convert INPUT.png -resize 400 -quality 75 OUTPUT.pn g
 #+end_src
